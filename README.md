Employee DB
====================
C++ Employee Management Application

#### Problem Statement
A program to manage a company’s employee records needs to be flexible and have useful features.
The feature set for this program includes the following:
* The ability to add an employee
* The ability to fire an employee
* The ability to promote an employee
* The ability to view all employees, past and present
* The ability to view all current employees
* The ability to view all former employees

The design for this program divides the code into three parts. The Employee class encapsulates the
information describing a single employee. The Database class manages all the employees of the
company. A separate UserInterface file provides the interactivity of the program.
